## Scaling Efficiency Analysis

### Strong Scaling (Fixed Total Batch Size)
- **1-8 GPUs:** >92% efficiency - Excellent
- **16 GPUs:** 89% efficiency - Meets target
- **32 GPUs:** 84% efficiency - Good
- **64+ GPUs:** 63-77% efficiency - Expected for massive scale

### Communication Overhead
As GPU count increases, communication becomes the bottleneck:
- **1-8 GPUs:** <10% overhead
- **16 GPUs:** 12.3% overhead (within target)
